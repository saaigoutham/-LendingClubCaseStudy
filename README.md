## Conclusions
- Loan Applications received for amounts ranging from 10K USD to 30K USD with LC assigned grading of ‘G’ category needs to be scrutinized and checked as the tendency to default in such case is High
- Customers applying for the loan amounts in the range of 27,500 USD or higher should be checked for the past history including but not limited to the public record instances during the loan approval process as there were significant default customers in this loan range in cases company approved loan amounts were lower than the applied loan amounts. It seems some amount of risk was absorbed in such cases with approval of lesser loan amount but resulted in relatively high number of defaulters
- Small businesses loans have more defaulters, hence business loans dispersal should be strengthen with better checks for reducing the defaults
- Credit hungry applicants i.e. Customers with past history of >5 enquiry in last 6 months should be verified carefully with Due Credentials about Good Credit History 
- People with significance past history of public records and bankruptcy must be handled with more precautions particularly for higher amount of loans. Few public record instances in Credit History shouldn’t be taken lightly during loan application evaluation as this lapse was evident in the given data for more number of defaulters in such cases
- Loans approved for amounts higher than 10,000 USD and longer term of 60 months have defaulted double in numbers so loan approval process in such cases needs to be strengthened with more checks
